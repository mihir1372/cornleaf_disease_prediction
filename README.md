# P24: Explainable Corn Leaf Disease Prediction

<p>This project implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the type of disease in a corn leaf. The performance of the model was compared with popular pre-trained models - ResNet-50, VGG-16, and EfficientNet-v2 M through transfer learning. The best model was found to be ResNet-50 with a classification accuracy of 95.12%</p>


### How to run the code:
- In a terminal, run the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary liraries. These can even be installed inside a virtual environment.
- The code for training the models, SHAP analysis, and model evaluation is present in the `model_training_evaluation` directory.
